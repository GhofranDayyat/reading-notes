# EJS 
**EJS** is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.

# Using the API

**API keys**: A request that does not provide an OAuth 2.0 token must send an API key. The key identifies your project and provides API access, quota, and reports.


**authorization**
Your application must use OAuth 2.0 to authorize requests. No other authorization protocols are supported. If your application uses Google Sign-In, some aspects of authorization are handled for you

**OAuth 2.0**: Whenever your application requests private user data, it must send an OAuth 2.0 token along with the request. Your application first sends a client ID and, possibly, a client secret to obtain a token.

**Google Books IDs**
1. Volume IDs - Unique strings given to each volume that Google Books knows about. An example of a volume ID is _LettPDhwR0C. You can use the API to get the volume ID by making a request that returns a Volume resource; you can find the volume ID in its id field.

2. Bookshelf IDs - Numeric values given to a bookshelf in a user's library. Google provides some pre-defined shelves for every user with the following IDs:

``https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&as_coll=0&num=10&uid=11122233344455566778&source=gbs_slider_cls_metadata_0_mylibrary``

3. User IDs - Unique numeric values assigned to each user. These values are not necessarily the same ID value used in other Google services.
