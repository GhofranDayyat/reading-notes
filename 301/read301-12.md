# EJS Partials


 * they make large websites easier to maintain as you donâ€™t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it 
 appears in.

 * Instead, you define that reusable bundle of code in a file andinclude it wherever you need it.

 * After we have our partials defined we can use them in our home.ejs and post.ejs templates! In EJS, any JavaScript or 
 non-HTML syntax you include in your templates is always surrounded by ``<% %>`` delimiters
 ``<%- include( PARTIAL_FILE ) %>``

 * The`` <%- %>`` tags allow us to output the unescaped content onto the page
