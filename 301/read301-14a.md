# Database normalization

* **Database normalization** is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns
* he idea is that a table should be about a specific topic and that only those columns which support that topic are included. 

# Reasons for Normalization 
1. To minimize duplicate data
2. To minimize or avoid data modification issues
3. To simplify queries

# Duplicated information presents two problems:

1. It increases storage and decreases performance.
2. It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes

# Definition of Normalization

* **First Normal Form** – The information is stored in a relational table and each column contains atomic values, and there are not repeating groups of columns.

* **Second Normal Form** – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.

* **Third Normal Form** – The table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key.
