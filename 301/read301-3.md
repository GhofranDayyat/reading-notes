# Javascript Templating & MUSTACHE
**Javascript templating** is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic

**MUSTACHE**is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

``Mustache.render(“Hello, {{name}}”, { name: “Sherlynn” });``

``// returns: Hello, Sherlynn``
