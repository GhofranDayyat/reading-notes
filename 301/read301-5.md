# HEROKU

**Heroku** is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps — we’re the fastest way to go from idea to URL, bypassing all those infrastructure headaches.

``Node.js``s an open source, cross-platform runtime environment, which allows you to build server-side and networking applications. It’s written in JavaScript and can be run within the Node.js runtime on any platform.

**why we use it**Error pages are not what typically appear on your screen when you're surfing the web, but when it happens it's so annoying! To see how servers work from within, we will build a simple web server by ourselves. We will use Node.js as a server part technology for that task. Then we'll use Heroku cloud application platform to turn this local server into a world wide server.
