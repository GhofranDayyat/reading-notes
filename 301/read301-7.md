# REST

* the important of capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.
* The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. 
* REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.
* the function of URLs: 
1. tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept. 
2. Every programming language, database, or other kind of system has a different way of talking about nouns. That's why the URL is so important. It let's all of these systems tell each other about each other's nouns
*  representations  use those same protocols to send messages back and forth to each other.
