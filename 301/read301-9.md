# functional programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data —

**pure functions**It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects


**Pure functions benefits**
1. easier to test
2. state cannot change after it’s created.
3.  If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

## Referential transparency
a function consistently yields the same result for the same input

``pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency``

## Functions as first-class entities
functions are also treated as values and used as data.

**Functions as first-class entities can:**
- refer to it from constants and variables
- pass it as a parameter to other functions
- return it as result from other functions

## Filter function 
if the callback expression is true, the filter function will include the element in the result collection. Otherwise, it will not.
