## How to Solve Programming Problems?


* Programming is automation plain and simple.  You may have the ability to skip the manual steps and jump directly to code, but there is a manual process which is the foundation of any code you write.


* **A simple set of steps:**
1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.




## How you can Become  More Productive
* Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive
* “Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness,Busyness and Stress Are the Enemy
* The most successful people I know are not busy. Being busy is a form of mental laziness.” -Tim Ferriss
* Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.”
* You Can Do Amazing Things, But Only If You Have Time to Do Them
* Take stock of the things you did this week. How many of them were worthy of $1,000/hour?



## How to think like a programmer 
* Problem-solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for….more than programming languages proficiency, debugging, and system design.
* Have a framework
* steps
1. **Understand**Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).


2. **Plan**Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!


3. **Divide**Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).

4. **Stuck? Do Debug** Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).



## 5 Whys to Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly
1. **Assemble a Team**
Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix.
2. **Define the Problem**
If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on.
3. **Ask the First "Why?"**
Ask your team why the problem is occurring. Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.
4. **Know When to Stop**
You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further
5.  Address the Root Cause(s)and Monitor Your Measures
