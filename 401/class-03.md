# Express Routing 
**Routing** refers to how an applicationâ€™s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.

## Routing Types
1. Route methods: as GET method route POST method route
2. Route paths :in combination with a request method, define the endpoints at which requests can be made.
3. Route parameters:  are named URL segments that are used to capture the values specified at their position in the URL. 
4. Route handlers: You can provide multiple callback functions that behave like middleware to handle a request. 
5. Response methods:The methods on the response object (res) 
6. app.route() :used to create chainable route handlers for a route path Because the path is specified at a single location, creating modular routes is helpful, as is reducing redundancy and typos
7. express.Router: class to create modular, mountable route handlers.



# Express Router

**Express Router**: It is a mini express application without an express application, just the routing stuff. 
``var router = express.Router();``
1. Basic Routes: Home, About
``router.get('/',CB)``

2. Route Middleware to log requests to the console
``router.use(function(req, res, next) {}``

3. Route with Parameters
``router.get('/hello/:name',CB)``

4. Route Middleware for Parameters to validate specific parameters
``router.param('name', function(req, res, next, name) {}``

5. Login routes  define multiple actions on a single login route. We'll need a *GET* route to show the login form and a *POST* route to process the login form.
``app.route('/login')``
``.get(function(req, res) {}``
``.post(function(req, res) {}``

6. Validates a parameter passed to a certain route



# ES6 Classes
**Classes** are in fact "special functions", and just as you can define function expressions and function declarations, the class syntax has two components: **class expressions** and **class declarations**.

* Class declarations :class keyword with the name of the class
* difference between function declarations and class declarations : function declarations are hoisted and class declarations are not.
* Class expressions:can be named or unnamed. 
* The body of a class is the part that is in curly brackets {}. This is where you define class members, such as methods or constructor

# Middleware 
**Middleware** is  functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (Links to an external site.) (res)


# Test-driven development (TDD) 
**TDD** is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later.

**Behavioural Testing** is a testing of the external behaviour of the program, also known as black box testing. It is usually a functional testing.
