| non-relational or distributed database| Relational Databases|
|databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores| Relational Databases|
|have dynamic schema for unstructured data| have predefined schema|
| databases are horizontally scalable|databases are vertically scalable|
|queries are focused on collection of documents|uses SQL ( structured query language )|
|lassify SQL databases as either open-source or close-sourced from commercial vendors|classified on the basis of way of storing data as graph databases, key-value store databases, document store databases, column store database and XML databases.|

## types
**SQL database examples:** MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. 
**NoSQL database examples:** MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb

## MongoDB
 is one of the most popular document based NoSQL database as it stores data in JSON like documents. It is non-relational database with dynamic schema. It has been developed by the founders of DoubleClick, written in C++ 

 
**MongoDB benefits and strengths:**
**Speed**: For simple queries, it gives good performance, as all the related data are in single document which eliminates the join operations.
**Scalability**: It is horizontally scalable i.e. you can reduce the workload by increasing the number of servers in your resource pool instead of relying on a stand alone resource.
**Manageable**: It is easy to use for both developers and administrators. This also gives the ability to shard database
**Dynamic Schema**: Its gives you the flexibility to evolve your data schema without modifying the existing data

**Documents**: it's  a rows in your table it's written as a json format
**horizontally Scale:** add more servers then merge data into one DB 
**Vertically Scale:** improve server capacity 
## Who is the winner MongoDB OR mySQL ?
* that's depends kide of application and kind of the data will be store  


**Functional programming**
* pure mathematical functions style.
* It is a declarative type of programming style.
* Its main focus is on “what to solve” in contrast to an imperative style where the main focus is “how to solve”. 
* It uses expressions instead of statements. An expression is evaluated to produce a value, whereas a statement is executed to assign variables. 

**Object-oriented programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).


**Classes** are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data inside {}.

The **super** keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.
``super.prop`` ``super[expr]``

* When used in a constructor, the super keyword appears alone and must be used before the this keyword is used. 
**Jest**Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

**A REST API** (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer 

**data model** (or datamodel) is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.

**CI** : workflow strategy, development features with modular code in more manageable increments

**CD** : developing software , that you could release it at any time , it’s an extention of Continuous Delivery(CD) actually it’s process that allow you to deploy


# Questions
1.
* reduces the time required for project development
* With TDD you will get a reliable solution
* Better program design and higher code quality
* Developers who work with the TDD approach, have more structured thinking and usually provide better estimates.
