# Git : is a version-control system for tracking changes in any set of files.

## Git Command

* we create our own git init or we clone it from a repository using:
git clone repolink
* We mainly need A-C-P commands to work the basic features of git on our software files;

1. git add filename

2. git commit -m "brief explanation of why you made the change "

3. git push 

* To get the changes made elsewhere on our files we use:
git pull


## Git use to:
*	Reduce risk of data loss, since files are synchronized with remote repositories.
*	Enables collaboration between multiple developers on a software project.
*	Allows you to track file revision to show a change history.

# You can understand the gate sequence
