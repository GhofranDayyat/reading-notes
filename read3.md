# Chapter 1: Structure
* HTML pages are structured into a head and a body, only information in the body will appear to the user
## The body is then structured into
*	Header, which can include the name of the poage and some navigation options
* 	Main, which includes the actual content of the page

# Chapter 18: Process and Design
** This Chapter discusses a process that you can use when you are creating a new website.
Every website should be designed for the target audience not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is. and understand who your visitors are,  most will visit for a specific reason. We can summarize the chapter in some points: **
*  Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site
* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
*  Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
* You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
*  You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

# Chapter 17: HTML5 Layout
* The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
* The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple div elements).
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google
* CSS is a language that adds visual styles and variations… it can be added inside the HTML elements to give it a visual treatment.

# Chapter 8: Extra Markup
* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML is 5 you are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the <!– and –> markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
* The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
* <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
* The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
