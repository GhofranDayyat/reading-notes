# JavaScript & jQuery

## JavaScript (Js): is a high-level programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.
## jQuery it makes writing JavaScript a lot easier and will help you deal with cross-browser inconsistencies



## Script is series of instruction computer can follow to achieve a goal.

## A browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the web page


### To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

# JavaScript Syntax
We write JavaScript code inbetween an HTML tag:
<script></script>

# Change HTML Content
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript";

# Expressions + Operators
## EXPRESSIONS
An **expression** evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of **expressions**.
- EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE 
- EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE 

## OPERATORS
Expressions rely on things called **operators** they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
also there is **ARITHMETI C OPERATORS** and **STRING OPERATOR**  

## ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
•	Addition + Adds one value to another
•	Subtraction - Subtracts one value from another
•	Division / Divides two values
•	MULTIPLICATION * Multiplies two values using an asterisk
•	INCREMENT ++ Adds one to the current number
•	DECREMENT – Subtracts one from the current number
•	MODULUS % Divides two values and returns the remainder
